Bootcamp Homework

This is our first bootcamp HW. Added all the semantic elements required-- however some of the styling is still incorporated with the CLASS. Instead of renaming them, I left them alone, not sure if this would pose a problem when the semantic is being read.

Kept the header fixed but couldn't figure out a way to space the anchor tag to hit a specific section on the page.
